## makecachematrix function should create return a list of 4 functions to control x which is created in another environment to be stored as a cache
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {

## cachesolve function should check if the solve function for element was already calculated before then retrive the old value if not it will calculate it 
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getsolve()
